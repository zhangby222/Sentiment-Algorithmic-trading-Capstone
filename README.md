# Algorithmic trading model for GBP/USD market using NLP and XGBOOST

This project is originally designed as my Master's degree thesis with Professor Gordon Bodnar, who provides advices on the simulation trading module. 

**This project will be finished in mid-June.**

It will also serve as the capstone project for Data Incubator. I plan to keep working on this project in two ways:

1. Developing more efficient web-scraping tools and connect the Bloomberg API. The instant alert function of Bloomberg terminal is the most optimal financial news sources, but because our library is closed right now, I temporarily have no access to Bloomberg terminals.
2. Try shallow neural nets as the predictive model, as I have read a very interesting paper about how to make neural nets fast and accurate  enough for algo trading.
3. Design the user interface to make it possible for business (SELL IT LOL)

**Please note that this project is still under development so PRs are not accepted.**
